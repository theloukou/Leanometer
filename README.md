# Leanometer
Arduino-based motorcycle leanometer

This is version 1 of my open-source motorcycle leanometer, based on *Arduino*.
Designed mainly to be compact, low cost, and easy to assemble with household equipment/average soldering skills.

3D printed enclosure has been tested to be water resistant over 12 hour water exposure. Additional weather proofing can be achieved by using some kind of conformal coating on electronics (i.e. Kontakt Plastik 70).

Additional parts needed are:
1.  **GY-521 MPU-6050** IMU module
2. 26.5mm x 29mm x 3mm Plexiglass piece
3. 6 pieces of M2.5x5mm bolts
4. some kind of 2 component adhesive/thermoglue
